# ISEAK_mw_report_2022
This repository contains the codes, logfiles and output from an attempt to replicate the report on the 2019 MW in Spain.

The original report was elaborated by the ISEAK Fundation and can be found here: https://iseak.eu/publicacion/the-impact-of-the-increase-in-the-minimum-wage-on-inequality-and-employment

To replicate the entire analysis, you can use the "Master dofile.do", but be sure to update the paths first.

This is not a perfect replicate as some results may differ from the report.
